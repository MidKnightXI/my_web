# Script to setup Arch with LVM
[1.1] Bash script to configure your Arch linux with LVM

[WARNING]
- The script is installing XFCE and LightDM as a display manager, you can modify it into arch_setup.sh
- The default "mirrorlist" is replaced by french mirrors, you can modify the file "mirrorlist" as you want to.

1. launch the arch_config.sh
2. follow instructions
3. ENJOY and star my repo !!! :D
