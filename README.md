# script_archlinux_config
[1.0] Bash script to configure your Archilinux perfectly with LVM

[WARNING] : - the script is installing XFCE and GDM as a display manager, you can modify it into arch_setup.sh
            - All the script instructions are translated by myself so it may have some errors
1. launch the arch_config.sh
2. follow instructions
3. ENJOY !!! :D
