# script_archlinux_config
[1.1] Bash script to configure your Archilinux perfectly with LVM

[WARNING] :

- the script is installing XFCE and LightDM as a display manager, you can modify it into arch_setup.sh.

- the default "mirrorlist" is replaced by french mirrors, you can modify the file "mirrorlist" as you want to.

- All the script instructions are translated by myself so it may have some errors

1. launch the arch_config.sh
2. follow instructions
3. ENJOY !!! :D
